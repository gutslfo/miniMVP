1. Remove temp file from heredoc in pipes without breaking everything that's working now
2. Check leaks for existing builtins
3. Make remaining builtins
4. Check error management and leaks on errors
5. It should be possible to call a command using it's absolute path.
	For example: < file /usr/bin/grep foo is a valid command.
	+ calling a command this way should bypass the removal of the PATH env variable.
6. Modify command arguments parsing to not split when encountering '=', or at least make it stick for the export command
7. Make sure we correctly free the new_env tab
	At the end of the program
	In case of an error in related builtins and functions
8. Change $PWD in case of cd
9. Investigate and handle $SHLVL and $BASH_SUBSHELL
10. Implement solo redirs
11. Check builtin args for unexpected scenarios (example export without any argument prints env in alphabetical order)
12. Make sure we free envp when an error occurs
	Maybe distinguish between a full_clean func and a partial_clean func
13. Subshell
